# Tank1 Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the Tank1 Application

In order to build the Tank1 application, or any other F´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd Tank1
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the Tank1 application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd Tank1
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the Tank1 app:
```
cd Tank1
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd Tank1/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./Tank1 -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
