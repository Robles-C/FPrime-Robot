# üõ†Ô∏è I¬≤C-Based Motor Controller (Final Project ‚Äì ECE 526L)

This project implements a custom motor control system using the I¬≤C protocol, developed entirely in Verilog on the Zybo Z7-10 FPGA. It was created as the final project for ECE 526L: Digital Design With Verilog.

## üîß Overview

In the original robot system, a Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu 22.04 communicated with a DFRobot Romeo motor controller to control motor speed and direction. This project replaces the Romeo board with a fully hardware-based solution on the FPGA.

### ‚ú¥Ô∏è System Architecture

- **Raspberry Pi 4 (Master)**
  - Sends 2 bytes via I2C: one for direction, one for speed

- **Zybo Z7-10 FPGA (Slave)**
  - Receives and decodes bytes using an 8 state finite state machine
  - Converts decoded speed byte into PWM signal
  - No embedded software involved

## Robot Demo

The robot successfully moved in response to Pi-sent commands. This demonstrates hardware decoding and control without any software intervention on the FPGA.
