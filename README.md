**Persistance** is a modular ground robot powered by <a href="https://github.com/nasa/fprime" target="_blank">NASAâ€™s FÂ´ (F Prime)</a> flight software framework. Designed for reliable motion control, obstacle sensing, and autonomous decision-making, it uses a differential drive system with real-time feedback from a gyro, encoder, ultrasonic sensor, and a vision sensor mounted on a servo-actuated arm. The software follows the FÂ´ Applicationâ€“Managerâ€“Driver design pattern, with modular components handling sensor data, control logic, and communication.

**Inventiveness** is an onboard aerial platform designed to launch from the Tank chassis. It features an ESP32 XIAO flight controller and a custom PCB integrating an MPU6050 IMU, VL53L0X time-of-flight sensor, and discrete motor drivers. The drone is intended for future autonomous operations such as aerial photography or scout maneuvers.

## System Overview

The robotâ€™s software is architected using the <a href="https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/user-manual/design-patterns/app-man-drv/" target="_blank"><strong>Application-Manager-Driver</strong></a> pattern, with custom FÂ´ components for motion control, high-level logic, and environment sensing.
